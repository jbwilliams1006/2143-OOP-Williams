#### Composition

> It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.

#### Encapsulation

> Refers to the combining of an object's attributes and behaviors into a single package, i.e. a class. The programmer then can then access the methods and properties of the class without having to understand the implementation.

#### Friends

> A friend class is a class that can access the private and protected members of a class in which it is declared as friend. This is needed when we want to allow a particular class to access the private and protected members of a class.
>

#### Inheritance

> Refers to the capability of creating a new class from an existing class. 
>

#### Instance Variable

> A variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance 
>

#### Member Variable

> A variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods 
>

#### Method

> Operations (or actions) that objects perform or operations which are performed to an object. Sometimes referred to as behaviors.

#### Multiple Inheritance

> A feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. 
>

#### Object

> A thing that can be seen and touched (and manipulated). It is an instance of a class.

#### Overloading

> A programming concept that allows programmers to define two or more functions with the same name and in the same scope. Function overloading is a programming concept that allows programmers to define two or more functions with the same name and in the same scope

#### Polymorphism

> The ability of different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.
>

#### Public/Private/Protected

> Three types of access modifiers in c++ which decides the accessibility of class members. Public means everyone is allowed to access, private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access, and protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed.

#### Virtual

> The term virtual is used among computer scientists to distinguish something that is merely conceptual from something that has an absolute, physical reality. EX:Virtual memory refers to an imaginary set of locations or addresses, which are converted into real memory addresses when the program or application is executed. It is not the same as the real.
